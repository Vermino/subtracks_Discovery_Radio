## 2026-01-30 - Hardcoded Infrastructure Credentials
**Vulnerability:** Found hardcoded credentials (password and API key) in `lib/config/infrastructure_config.dart`.
**Learning:** Unused or "development only" configuration files are a common source of secret leaks because they are often overlooked during code reviews. Even if code is unused, its presence in the repository exposes the secrets.
**Prevention:** Use environment variables for ALL credentials, including local development configurations. Scan "utility" or "config" folders specifically for hardcoded strings.
